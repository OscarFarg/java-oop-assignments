# Java Object Oriented Programming Assignments
This repository contains a couple of java object oriented programming assignments starting easy and gradually becoming harder as
 you go through the different assignments.
Each assignment builds on the next assignment so you'll have to complete an assignment before you can continue. Each assignment will be
 it's own maven project to ease development and building the application.
 
We will be building a digital hospital where patients will be able to visit for all there medical needs.
 
The solutions for each assignment can be found in the solutions branch.
 
If you have any suggestions for improvement please let me know or sent a pull-request.
